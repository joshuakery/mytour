BONUS

I created a navigation system that requires users to "discover" new rooms in a map of my house by first reaching them
via navigation buttons on the detail page for each place. The rooms are only then accessible via links in the map.

This required me to conditionally style the Link elements on my map page. I also use an event handler to remember what
the "current" room the user is currently in, in order to style that room on the map with a red border, and in order to
link the 'BACK' button to that room, as if the user had stepped out of the house to see the map and would like to return
to the room they were just in.
